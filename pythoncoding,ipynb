Q1. #Python program to find Factorial of a number 

Solution:- 
#In the below approach, the factorial program takes input from the user as an integer and assigns it to the variable n. 
#It then initializes the variable factorial to 1. 
#If n is greater than or equal to 1, 
#it enters a for loop that iterates from 1 to n (inclusive) 
#and multiplies factorial by each value of i in the loop.
Code

n = int (input ("Enter a number: "))
factorial = 1
if n >= 1:
    for i in range (1, n+1):
        factorial=factorial *i
print("Factorial of the given number is: ", factorial)

Test cases with expected output:-
Enter a number: 5
Factorial of the given number is:  120
Enter a number: 4
Factorial of the given number is:  24
Enter a number: 7
Factorial of the given number is:  5040
Enter a number: 8
Factorial of the given number is:  40320
Enter a number: 9
Factorial of the given number is:  362880
